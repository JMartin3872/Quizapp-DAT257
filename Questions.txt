Trains are one of the most environmentally friendly modes of transportation. A trip from Stockholm to Gothenburg by high-speed train emits significantly less carbon dioxide than the equivalent flight or car trip. High-speed trains in Sweden often run on electricity from renewable sources, making the journey even more climate-friendly.
Cheese Sandwiches: Two cheese sandwiches with butter every day for a year.

Cheese has a relatively high environmental impact due to emissions from dairy production, mainly from cows. Large resources are required to produce cheese. Greenhouse gases come from both animal digestion and feed production.

District heating is an efficient and relatively environmentally friendly heating method in Sweden. It often uses waste heat from electricity production or waste incineration.
Halved Food Waste: Reduced emissions from halving food waste over a year for an average Swede.

Food waste is a significant environmental problem as resources such as water, land, and energy are wasted. Reducing food waste can greatly reduce the total greenhouse gas emissions from food production.
Heating with Electric Heaters: Heating a 140 m² house in central Sweden with direct electric heating (Swedish electricity mix).

How environmentally friendly electric heating is depends on where the electricity comes from. In Sweden, electricity is largely renewable, making electric heating relatively climate-smart.
Flights: Swedish yearly average. Flying as an average Swede over a year (CO₂ only).

Air travel accounts for a significant portion of individual carbon emissions. An average Swede flies much more compared to many other countries, which has a major impact on the climate since flying is very emissions-intensive.
T-bone Steak: Beef. A meal with 150g of beef every day for a year.
3000 KG
2000 KG
4000 KG
Beef production is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases within the food industry. This is primarily due to methane emissions from cows and the large amounts of water and feed required for meat production.
Hand Washing Dishes: Using filled water. Washing dishes with filled water from district heating every day for a year.

Hand washing dishes in filled water can be more environmentally friendly than letting the water run, but it is usually less energy-efficient than using a modern dishwasher, especially if it is run full.
Pork Shoulder: Pork. A meal with 150g of pork every day for a year.
